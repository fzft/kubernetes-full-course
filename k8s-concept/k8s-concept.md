- POD
    - containers(docker) are encapsulated into kubernetes object known as pods
    - a pod is a single instance of an application
    - smallest object in kubernetes
    - scale up instance
        - if you need to add additional instances, create a new pod altogether with a new instance of the same application
        - if current node has no sufficient capacity, you can always deploy additional pods on a new node in the cluster
    - pods usually have a one to one relationship with containers 
    - multiple container in a pod
        - a single pod can have multiple containers , except for the fact that they're usually not multiple containers of the same kind
        - sometimes you might have a scenario where you have a helper container that might be doing some support task for our application, you can have both of these containers part of the same pod
        - the two containers also communicate with each other directly by referring to each other as localhost, since they share some network space, the same storage space as well
